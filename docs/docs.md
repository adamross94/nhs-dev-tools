This documentation project has been crafted to offer a comprehensive introduction to a wide array of open-source technologies that can be leveraged across the NHS. These technologies range from app development, data analytics, and visualization, to project management, and even extend into advanced fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The NHS is a complex ecosystem composed of various organizations, each with varying degrees of familiarity with open-source tools. Therefore, this project aims to consolidate technical resources, guides, and user experiences to facilitate easier adoption and implementation. Often, organizations can find the array of choices daunting and may revert to costly paid services with significant licensing fees. This guide seeks to demystify open-source options, presenting them as viable, cost-effective alternatives that can drive innovation and efficiency within the NHS. By doing so, it hopes to empower organizations to make informed decisions and encourage a more collaborative and resourceful approach to technology in healthcare.
