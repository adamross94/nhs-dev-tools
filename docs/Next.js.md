[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source React framework developed by Vercel that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. Created in 2016, Next.js has grown to become one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web applications, particularly those requiring server-side rendering or static site generation.

## Why Next.js for the NHS?

Next.js is an excellent choice for the NHS due to several key features:

- **Performance**: Next.js optimizes performance through server-side rendering and static site generation, improving load times and SEO[^1]. This is crucial for public-facing NHS services, as it ensures content stays fresh without sacrificing performance.
- **Scalability**: Next.js simplifies scaling with its hybrid rendering model, allowing projects to handle increased traffic and content without compromising performance[^1]. This is essential for NHS platforms that may experience sudden spikes in usage.
- **Developer Experience**: Next.js offers features like Fast Refresh for immediate feedback on changes to React components and Hooks, allowing developers to quickly iterate and see changes in real-time[^2]. This intuitive API and built-in optimizations allow NHS developers to focus on creating features rather than configuration.
- **Security**: Server-side rendering can help mitigate certain client-side vulnerabilities, enhancing the security of NHS web applications.

## Getting Started with Next.js

Setting up a Next.js project is straightforward, especially with the support of the Node.js environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed. If not, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Initialize a New Next.js Project

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands to create a new Next.js project:

  ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-nhs-next-app
  ```

Change your current directory to the newly created project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-nhs-next-app
   ```

Start the development server, making your Next.js application ready for development and testing.

  ```bash
    npm run dev
  ```

This command sets up a new Next.js project and starts the development server.

### 3. View Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. This URL points to the local server where your Next.js application is running. You should see the default Next.js welcome page, indicating that your setup is successful.



## Core Concepts in Next.js

Understanding a few core concepts will help you make the most of Next.js in your projects:

### Pages and Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system where files in the pages directory automatically become routes[^3][^4]. This is a fundamental concept in Next.js that simplifies the routing process. For example, creating a file named `about.js` in the pages directory will automatically make it accessible at /about. This approach eliminates the need for configuring routes manually, making it easy to manage and scale your application.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering, which can improve initial load time and SEO[^3][^4][^5]. SSR allows React components to be rendered on the server, generating the HTML before sending it to the client. This means users can see the content more quickly, and search engines can crawl the content more efficiently. You can implement SSR in Next.js by using `getServerSideProps`.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

Next.js offers static site generation (SSG) capabilities, enabling you to generate static HTML at build time. This approach can improve performance and reduce server load[^3][^4][^5], as pre-rendered pages can be served quickly without repeated server processing. SSG is particularly useful for content that doesn't change frequently, such as blogs or marketing pages. You can use `getStaticProps` to generate static pages in Next.js.

### API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions[^3][^4]. This feature enables you to build your API directly within your Next.js application, simplifying the development process by keeping both frontend and backend code in the same project. Files created in the pages/api directory automatically become API endpoints, which can be accessed via HTTP requests.

### Image Optimization

Next.js provides automatic image optimization for improved performance[^4][^5]. This includes features like automatic resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats such as WebP. The next/image component makes it easy to include optimized images in your project, reducing load times and improving the overall user experience.
