[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Created by Evan You in 2014, Vue has gained popularity due to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. It allows developers to create dynamic, responsive web applications with a gentle learning curve.

## Why Vue.js for the NHS?

Vue.js is particularly beneficial for the NHS because of its simplicity, efficiency, and progressive nature. It can be adopted incrementally, making it suitable for projects of any scale. Key benefits include:

- **Ease of Learning**: Vue.js is known for its straightforward syntax and low learning curve[^4][^5]. This is supported by the fact that Vue sits between jQuery and React in terms of learning curve[^4], making it easier to pick up for developers familiar with HTML and ES5 JavaScript. The comprehensive and well-laid-out documentation also contributes to its ease of learning.
- **Reactivity**: Vue's data binding and reactivity systems make it easy to keep the UI in sync with the underlying data model[^1][^5]. Vue enforces a one-way data flow between components, which simplifies the flow of data and makes it easier to reason about in non-trivial applications.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Vue's component-based architecture helps in building reusable UI components, which can improve development efficiency and application maintainability[^2][^3]. This architecture is highlighted as a key feature that promotes reusability and maintainability, essential for large-scale systems.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Vue offers a comprehensive set of tools for development, testing, and deployment, enhancing productivity[^1][^2]. The ecosystem includes official libraries for routing (Vue Router) and state management (Vuex or Pinia)[^1], which are well-integrated with the framework. Additionally, Vue CLI provides a standard tooling baseline, ensuring that various build tools work smoothly together.

## Getting Started with Vue.js

Setting up a Vue.js project is straightforward, especially with the Vue CLI. Below are the detailed steps to get you started:

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. This will also install npm, the Node package manager.
- **Git**: While not strictly necessary, having Git installed can help with version control and managing your codebase.

### 2. Install Vue CLI

[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) is a powerful tool for scaffolding Vue.js projects. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Vue CLI globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### 3. Create a New Vue Project

Once the Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new Vue project. In your terminal, run:

```bash
vue create my-nhs-vue-app
```

Follow the prompts to select the default settings or customize your project configuration as needed.

### 4. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Move into the directory of your newly created project:

```bash
cd my-nhs-vue-app
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

To see your Vue application in action, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### 6. View Your Application

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080/ to see your Vue application running. You should see the default Vue.js welcome page, indicating that everything is set up correctly.

## Core Concepts in Vue.js

To effectively work with Vue.js, understanding the following core concepts is essential. These concepts form the foundation of Vue.js and will help you build dynamic and interactive web applications.

### Components

Vue components are reusable Vue instances with a name. They allow you to encapsulate reusable code and logic into self-contained units. Each component can have its own template, script, and style, making it easier to manage and organize your code. Components can communicate with each other using props and events, enabling you to build complex user interfaces by composing simpler components[^6]. For example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  props: ['title']
}
</script>
```

### Directives

Vue directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to perform specific actions on a DOM element. Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate they are special attributes provided by Vue[^7]. Some common directives include:

- **`v-model`**: Enables two-way data binding between form inputs and the Vue instance data.
- **`v-if`**: Conditionally renders elements based on the truthiness of an expression.
- **`v-for`**: Renders a list of items by iterating over an array or object.

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <input v-model="message">
  <p v-if="message">You typed: {{ message }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: ''
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Computed Properties

Computed properties are used to derive new data from existing data in a declarative and efficient way. Unlike methods, computed properties are cached based on their dependencies, meaning they will only re-evaluate when one of their dependencies changes. This makes computed properties ideal for expensive operations that depend on reactive data[^8]. For example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Original message: {{ message }}</p>
    <p>Reversed message: {{ reversedMessage }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  },
  computed: {
    reversedMessage() {
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Example of Vue.js in Action

Below is a compilation of projects built using Vue.js:

- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/): The popular streaming service Netflix leverages Vue.js for some of its user interface components. Vue.js helps Netflix create a seamless and interactive user experience, enhancing navigation and responsiveness on their platform..
- [Trello Clone](https://github.com/zackthoutt/vue-trello): This project is a clone of the popular project management tool, Trello, built using Vue.js. It showcases the ability of Vue to handle complex state management and dynamic interfaces, allowing users to create boards, lists, and cards just like the original Trello application.
- [Vue Admin & Dashboard](https://github.com/fatihunlu/vue-admin-template?tab=readme-ov-file): Vue Admin Template is a comprehensive Vue.js-based admin and dashboard template. This template uses Vuetify components and styles to provide a modern and responsive user interface. It's ideal for building admin panels, dashboards, and web applications that require a robust and flexible UI framework.
- [Vue To-Do App](https://github.com/BurakGur/vue3-composition-api-todo-app?tab=readme-ov-file): This simple To-Do application is built using the Vue 3 Composition API. It demonstrates the practical application of Vue's new Composition API, offering a more flexible and scalable way to manage state and logic within your components. The app includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, showcasing how Vue can be used to build functional and interactive user interfaces.
